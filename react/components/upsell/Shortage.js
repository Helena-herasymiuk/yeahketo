      Why our stringent specs may cause a product shortage

    <p className="s1txt4">
      We insist on quality-certified U.S. organic growers of hemp who deliver
      the highest concentration of CBD with not a trace of the mind-altering
      THC. This is what makes our product legal in all 50 states without a
      prescription. <br />
      <br />
      Growers who meet all of our stringent specifications are hard to find. So
      far, we have found only one such grower, and he is scrambling to keep up
      with demand.<br />
      <br />
      That’s why it’s so urgent that you assure yourself of an adequate supply.
