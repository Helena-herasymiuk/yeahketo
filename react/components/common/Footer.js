                (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser
                information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP")
                is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your
                Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network
                ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be
                permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are
                automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information
                about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not
                identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of
                the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the
                Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area
                you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally,
                other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect
                the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.
